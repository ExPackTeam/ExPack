# ExPack 
ExPack is a library that lets you customize everything, being easy to use and able to adjust based on your needs!

ExPack was programmed in Visual Studio Code.

# To-Do
- [ ]  Have javascript modify margins
- [ ]  Add to a CDN
- [ ]  May add custom a element for sidebars

# Installs
To properly run this, please make sure you install [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/install/). The starting system for ExPack was using `npm install -g sass`.
## Compiling SASS
Originally (before having sass installed globally), the SASS (`.scss` files) was compiled using [json2csharp.com](https://json2csharp.com/css-tools/sass-to-css); so if you'd like you can use that.

As of September 4th, 2024, the original repository is being compiled by running (in the ExPack directory): `sass src/scss/global.scss dist/css/dist_global.css`.
