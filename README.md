> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use which ever IDE you'd like, these are just the ones that the original [owner](https://github.com/MicroRay620) used to make ExPack.
> If your IDE doesn't have Git support, run the Git Back terminal and then do the git commands there

### NPM
- ~~Webpack~~
    - ~~Terser Webpack Plugin~~

> [!NOTICE]
> Since 16/09/2024, devolpment of Expack v0.0.3, Expack has switched from using Webpack to Rollup


- Rollup
- Sass
- Babel
    - babel-loader
    - @babel/core
    - @babel/preset-env

All *npm* installs are localed in the **node_module** directory.

## Recommendations
To properly run this, please make sure you install [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/install/). The starting system for ExPack was using `npm install -g sass`.
## Compiling SASS
~~Originally (before having sass installed globally), the SASS (`.scss` files) was compiled using [json2csharp.com](https://json2csharp.com/css-tools/sass-to-css); so if you'd like you can use that.

As of September 4th, 2024, the original repository is being compiled by running (in the ExPack directory): `sass src/scss/global.scss dist/css/dist_global.css`.~~
As of September 16th, 2024, the original repository is being compiled at the same time as the js; by running `npm run build`.

## Compiling JS
With the addition of webpack (added September 7th, 2024), to bundle and minimize the javascript code you should run: `npm run build`. For more info look at the [rollup config](/rollup.config.js) file.
